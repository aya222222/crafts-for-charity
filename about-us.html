            <h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>
            <p>We are a small charitable group founded by a group of teenagers in Clarksville, Maryland in 2020. We were inspired to start this organization because we had trouble finding volunteering opportunities for our age group and skill level.</p>

        <section class="question our-mission">
            <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
            <p>Our goal is to provide accessible volunteering opportunities to people in Howard County of all ages and skill levels. By teaching crafting skills like knitting and card-making, we help members of our community create items like scarves, toys, cards, etc. that we donate to charities. We hope to create an easy and enjoyable way for people to give back to their community!</p>

        <section class="question why">
            <h2>WHY?</h2>
            <p>We realize that many people in our community want to help charities but don't have the resources, skills, or opportunities to do so. Our organization provides all the materials and resources needed so you can just attend and have fun!</p>

            <h2>PROGRESS</h2>
            <p>We are currently preparing to start holding small virtual knitting classes as pilot programs to gauge interest. Contact us if you are interested!</p>
